<h2>BRT Joining Instructions/Requirements<h2>

<p>
	<strong>
		Joining BRT requires the use of either a Smart Trainer or Powermeter, and an account on ZwiftPower
	</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Step 1:</strong> Ensure you have a Smart Trainer if you do not have a powermeter &mdash; some
	of the popular ones are Wahoo Kickr Core, Wahoo Kickr, Wahoo Snap, Tacx Neo, Tacx Flux and Tacx Vortex.
	Some older Elite trainers using the Misuro B+ sensor are not considered Smart Trainers.
</p>
<p>
	If your trainer is a 'dumb' trainer, you will require a Powermeter instead. For many races, you will
	also require a heart rate monitor that connects directly to Zwift.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Step 2:</strong> If you do not yet have a ZwiftPower account connected to Zwift, you may use
	our video guide: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEj7eqDdDnc'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEj7eqDdDnc</a>,
	or our step-by-step guide: <a href='https://boltrace.team/zwift-power-guide'>https://boltrace.team/zwift-power-guide</a>
	to help get you connected with ZwiftPower.
</p>

<p>
	In order to create a ZwiftPower account, you will need to know your Zwift ID. Instructions on how to find
	this can be found here: <a href='https://zwiftinsider.com/find-zwift-id/'>https://zwiftinsider.com/find-zwift-id/</a>,
	or you can use the following website, by putting in your Zwift login details (highly discouraged, try
	other methods first): <a href='https://www.virtualonlinecycling.com/p/zwiftid.html'>https://www.virtualonlinecycling.com/p/zwiftid.html</a>.
</p>

<p>
	You will not be able to complete the BRT membership form without a ZwiftPower account.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Step 3:</strong> Complete the membership form: <a href='https://portal.boltrace.team/members/join'>https://portal.boltrace.team/members/join</a>.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you have completed the membership form, you will receive a confirmation
	email. Please ensure you receive this email. If you do not, your email address may have been entered
	incorrectly. Please check your spam, then reach out if you have not received it.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Step 5:</strong> Request to join the BRT Facebook group (this requires approval) and introduce
	yourself to your fellow BRT team, so we know you have joined and can welcome you and get you involved
	in our events: <a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/brtzwift'>https://www.facebook.com/groups/brtzwift</a>.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Step 6:</strong> Recommended to create a WTRL account, this will be required if you wish to participate
	in the Zwift Racing League, or the WTRL Team Time Trial events: <a href='https://www.wtrl.racing'>https://www.wtrl.racing</a>.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Step 7:</strong> Once you have been approved, you'll receive an email detailing connecting to the
	BRT Clubhouse. This must be completed in order to access our private Discord server. If you have issues with
	this, please contact Jessica Hamilton directly: <a href='mailto:jessica.l.hamilton@gmail.com'>jessica.l.hamilton@gmail.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Step 8:</strong> Connect to our private Discord server. This is how we communicate with one another
	during social and raving events, and is best used with a headset. You may need to download the Discord app.
	The link is provided in your welcome email, but just in case you miss the details, they can also be found
	here: <a href='https://portal.boltrace.team/members/connect-to-discord'>https://portal.boltrace.team/members/connect-to-discord</a>.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Step 9:</strong> On the Zwift Companion App, at the end of your surname add [BRT] so that your team
	can be identified in-game.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Step 10:</strong> Eventually you will get an email to say your BRT kit has been applied for. Once you
	have received this, keep an eye on your Zwift garage for it to appear. Please wear this during events so
	that fellow team members can identify you. If you have not received this within four weeks, please contact
	Jessica Hamilton directly: <a href='mailto:jessica.l.hamilton@gmail.com'>jessica.l.hamilton@gmail.com</a>, or
	via Discord.
