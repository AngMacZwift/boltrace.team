Form Plugin for Discourse
=========================

An MVP to have an embedded form in a post, and collect results.

There is no form builder or anything of that sort, a form will need
to be created directly in the database. The initial goal is providing
a user interface for showing a form and filling it in.

It will be loosely based off the Discourse polls plugin.
