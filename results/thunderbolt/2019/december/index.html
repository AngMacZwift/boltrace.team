<h3>Welcome</h3>
<p>
	Welcome to the Five Day <strong>Thunder Bolt Stage Race</strong>, running from December 8th to December 13th. The stage race
	uses a time-based general classification, as well as having a sprinter and climber classification. The
	sprinter and climber classifications will award the first 6 of each grade points (10, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1) for
	all sprint and KOM segments in each race. Racers will need to complete at least four events plus the prolog to be counted
	in the classifications.
</p>
<p>
	Classifications will be split into two, one for the European timezone and one for the North American timezone. We have decided to
	also include a separate women's classification irresepective of numbers, to promote competition. We will also
	be trialing a teams classification, taking the fastest of each team from each day.
</p>
