<h2>Wild Women Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What Category Do I Race In?</h3>

<p>
	If this is your first race, you can <a href='/my-category'>check your category</a>, which
	will take your Zwift ID and check your race history. Your category will not always align
	with ZwiftPower, so please use the tool.
</p>

<p>
	If you have already completed a race in the current series, then you need to race in
	the category you finished in on ZwiftPower for your last race. You may choose to
	race in a higher category if you prefer, but you will not be able to race down a grade
	in later races. It is preferable to check results a day before entering, as results
	may not have been finalised. You can check the
	<a href='https://www.facebook.com/WildWomenRace/'>Wild Women Facebook Page</a> for
	news on race results.
</p>

<h3>What About Upgrades?</h3>

<p>
	If you end up being upgraded in a race, you will score points in the upgraded
	category. 50% of points you have accumulated prior will be carried over.
</p>

<p>
	However, you must start the race in the correct category to score points. Currently,
	there is an issue with the scoring system where this isn&rsquo;t yet taken into
	account, so please race fair by using the correct category.
</p>

<h3>What Bike Do I Use?</h3>

<p>
	For non-TT races, you can use any bike <em>except</em> for TT bikes. For TT races,
	you will need to select a TT frame. Whilst you can race without a TT frame, you will
	not be able to draft off other riders. Given that TT frames will generally be the
	fastest options available, it is recommended to choose one. You can learn more about
	TT bikes at	<a href='https://zwiftinsider.com/fastest-tt-bikes/'>Zwift Insider</a>.
</p>

<h3>Disqualifications/Demotions</h3>

<p>
	Women found using a shared account will be disqualified, as we cannot verify which
	category you should be racing in.
</p>

<p>
	Women using zPower for racing or women without a heart rate monitor will be
	ineligible for podiums, and will receive a time penalty to place them lower in
	results.
</p>

<h3>Switching Teams</h3>

<p>
	If you switch teams mid-league, points accrued for your previous team will remain
	with that team. Points accrued whilst racing with your new team will go to that team
	for the remaining races.
</p>

<h3>Who Do I Contact If I Have Questions About Results?</h3>

<p>
	Please use Facebook&rsquo;s messaging feature on our
	<a href='https://www.facebook.com/WildWomenRace/'>Facebook Page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Can I Race Both Times?</h3>

<p>
	Yes you can! For individual points, we will take your best point scoring finish
	of the two races. For teams points, we will add both results to the team total.
</p>

<h3>I Heard There Are Prizes</h3>

<p>
	Yes! Our partners at <a href='https://www.primaleurope.com/'>Primal Europe</a> are
	giving away &pound;10 for one lucky winner in each grade. You must complete four
	rounds to be eligible to win. Winners will be drawn at random from each grade.
