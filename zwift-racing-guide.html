<h2>Zwift Racing Guide</h2>

<p>Welcome to our basic guide to racing on Zwift. The aim is to try and answer any questions you may have
about joining the correct category or race results.</p>

<p>For <abbr title='Bolt Race Team'>BRT</abbr> races, you can use our <a href='/my-category'>handy calculator</a>.</p>

<h3>Category Calculation</h3>

<p>A rider&rsquo;s category is decided using 95% of their best 20 minute effort during a race, irregardless of length.
	<a href='https://www.zwiftpower.com/'>ZwiftPower</a> <strong>does not</strong> use your average power for a race,
	which is a common misconception.
</p>

<p>So the calculation is (20min power ร 0.95) รท rider weight (in kg). E.g. a 70kg rider with 245W = 3.5W/kg, which would
	put the rider into category B. The calculation is essentially how your <abbr title='Functional Threshold Power'>FTP</abbr>
	is calculated by many FTP tests in a W/kg format.
</p>

<h3>Categories</h3>

<p>First and foremost, <em>always</em> check an event&rsquo;s description. Not all races use the same brackets for their
categories!</p>

<p>Before you join a race, you&rsquo;ll need to know your W/kg potential. The best way to find this out is to perform an
	<abbr title='Functional Threshold Power'>FTP</abbr> test via Zwift&rsquo;s workout section. If you don&rsquo;t
	fancy that, then the second best option is to join a race that either doesn&rsquo;t use categories&mdash;such as a
	time trial race, or join the (<span style='color: red'>A</span>) category of a race.
</p>

<p>One of the most common category structures:
		<ol style='list-style-type: upper-alpha'>
				<li style='color:red;font-weight:bold'><span style='color:black;font-weight:normal'>4.0W/kg and OVER</span></li>
				<li style='color:green;font-weight:bold'><span style='color:black;font-weight:normal'>3.2W/kg to 3.69W/kg</span></li>
				<li style='color:lightseagreen;font-weight:bold'><span style='color:black;font-weight:normal'>2.5W/kg to 3.19W/kg</span></li>
				<li style='color:orange;font-weight:bold'><span style='color:black;font-weight:normal'>UNDER 2.5W/kg</span></li>
			</ol>
</p>

<p>However! As earlier stated, this is not the only category system out there! <strong>Read the event descriptions!</strong></p>

<p><img style='border: rgb(242, 120, 12) solid 2px' src='/assets/images/event-description.png' title='Zwift event description'/></p>

<p>For example, the <a href='/ages-league'>Ages Racing League</a> uses age-based categories, and the <a href='/wild-women-league'>Wild Women League</a>
	uses 3.7W/kg and over for the A category.
</p>

<p>In the event description you may find some additional rules that the race organizer requires you to comply with to get
	an official result at <a href='https://www.zwiftpower.com/'>ZwiftPower</a>. These can range from wearing heart rate monitors, to no power&ndash;ups,
	TT bikes only, or no results for zPower riders (no smart trainer/powermeter). So have a read beforehand, as there&rsquo;s nothing worse than
	putting in an all out effort only to find you&rsquo;re missing from results.
</p>

<h3>Connect to ZwiftPower</h3>

<p>While touching on missing results, it&rsquo;s worth mentioning GDPR. Since GDPR&rsquo;s introduction, racers who want to be included
	in results will now need to opt&ndash;in to <a href='https://www.zwiftpower.com/'>ZwiftPower</a> via <a href='https:///www.zwift.com/'>Zwift</a>,
	as well as having a <a href='https://www.zwiftpower.com/'>ZwiftPower</a> account, and agreeing to the terms and conditions. To make your life
	easier, we have a <a href='/zwift-power-guide'>guide</a> to help you set everything up correctly.
</p>

<h3>ZwiftPower Results</h3>

<p>If you find yourself removed from results during your Zwift racing career, take a look at the codes below which have explanations
	to why you were removed. It&rsquo;s always best to rectify the issue before your next race, or you may find yourself missing
	from the results on a regular basis!
</p>

<p>
	<strong>UPG/UPGRADE/WKG</strong>: rider has gone over category limits and must upgrade to the next category for the next race.<br/>
	<strong>HR</strong>: rider has been removed from results for failing to wear a heart rate monitor.<br/>
	<strong>ZP</strong>: rider has been removed from results for not using a smart trainer or powermeter.<br/>
	<strong>ZADA/5WKG</strong>: rider has breached the (A) category threshold and requires their data to be verified from real world
	data via ZADA (5W/kg for 20 minutes, 6W/kg for 5 minutes). To submit data, click on the link in your ZwiftPower profile.</br>
	<strong>UNK</strong>: rider&rsquo;s data&mdash;age, for example&mdash;is missing, causing category placement issue.
</p>

<h3>Event Descriptions</h3>

<p>A crucial part to entering a race is joining the correct category, that&rsquo;s those letters you see in coloured circles. For each
	race the categories may have different parameters, so it&rsquo;s important to read the description.
</p>

<p>Any good event organizer will list the category options/parameters with basic rules for the race. They may also publish links
	in the description for Facebook groups or websites, which may contain additional information or a direct contact to the race
	organizer. So reading the description or checking the web links out in advance will give riders a better understanding of
	what the race entails.
</p>

<p>Event descriptions are very easy to access now:</p>
