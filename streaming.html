<h2>Live Streaming with OBS</h2>

<p>
	With <abbr title="Open Broadcasting System">OBS Studio</abbr>, we have a branded template for use in
	live streams. This will include sponsorship details, and use BRT fonts, themes, and colours. The
	template will include BRT Orange and Hellcatz Purple specific variations, as well as a variation
	to include a web camera feed.
</p>

<h3>Required Tools</h3>

<ul>
	<li><a href='https://obsproject.com/'>OBS Studio</a></li>
	<li><a href='https://github.com/nleseul/obs-shaderfilter/releases'>OBS Shader Filter Plugin</a></li>
	<li><a href='https://boltrace.team/assets/OBS.zip'>OBS Template for BRT</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Recommended Streaming Platforms</h3>

<p>Restream.io will forward your stream to multiple platforms, and generally provides better quality forwarding

<h3>Using The Template</h3>

<p>After installing OBS Studio, install the plugin above by copying the files into the OBS installation directory,
	directions available in their <a href='https://github.com/nleseul/obs-shaderfilter'>README</a>. The plugin
	is what will provide the borders with rounded corners. Also install the provided fonts in the template package.
