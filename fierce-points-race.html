<h2>Fierce Felines Points Race Scoring</h2>

<p>This is an example of how the results of a points race is determind for scoring in the <a href='/fierce-felines'>Fierce Felines</a> events.</p>
<p>Points are awarded for the first 6 in each lap: 10, 7, 5, 3, 2, and 1. For the final sprint, points are doubled.</p>
<p>These points determine finish order, with ties broken by finish time. Points for the event uses the <a href='/fierce-points'>points table</a>.</p>
<p>In the example below, Larson finishes ahead of Hamilton, therefore taking 1st place. And even though Milleu was first across the line, because
	she didn't place as well in the intermediate sprints, did not win the race. In contrast, with Hamilton winning 3 intermediate sprints, despite
	crossing the finish line in 4th, still secured 2nd place. Lap 7 was the final lap, so double points were awarded.
